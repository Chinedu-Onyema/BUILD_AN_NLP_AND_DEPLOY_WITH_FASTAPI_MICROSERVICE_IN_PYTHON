# MASTERING FUNCTIONS BY BUILDING WITH FUNCTIONS

# A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO BUILD AN NLP, CREATE A DOCKER FILE, DEPLOY WITH FASTAPI, TEST IT WITH PYTEST USING GITHUB CODE SPACES, CLONE THE REPO IN AWS CLI, CREATE A REPOSITORY IN AWS ELASTIC CONTAINER REGISTRY (ECR), CLICK ON view push commands (follow the instructions by copying and pasting each step in your cloned AWS CLI).

# WHEN USING AWS SERVICES, SOME REGIONS DO NOT SUPPORT SOME SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT TO RUN THE AWS APP RUNNER FROM AN AWS ELASTIC CONTAINER REGISTRY (ECR) REPO AND THE LATTER WAS CREATED IN LET'S SAY STOCKHOLM WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY AWS, IF YOU WANT TO DEPLOY THAT SAME REPO TO AWS APP RUNNER, WE WILL HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE AWS DOES NOT SUPPORT THE AWS APP RUNNER SERVICE IN STOCKHOLM SO BE SURE TO CREATE INSTANCES IN SUPPORTED REGIONS.

# YOU CAN CHOOSE WHERE TO RUN YOUR CONTAINERS BUT MAKE SURE THE REGION SUPPORTS THAT SERVICE. OTHER SERVICES TO RUN YOUR CONTAINER STORED IN AN AWS ECR REPO ARE
ECS (ELASTIC CONTAINER SERVICE): Run your image in ECS (Fargate or EC2-backed)
EC2 DIRECTLY: SSH into EC2, pull the image from ECR, and run it with Docker.
USE LAMBDA IF IT IS A LAMBDA CONTAINER.
